DATA_EXTRACTION_AGENT_PROMPT = """

I want you to help extract data from webpage HTML about {products_type} products using the ReACT (Reasoning and Acting) approach.
Answer should be always in shape: {output_format}
Always verify your answer
Use a json blob to specify a tool by providing an action key (tool name) and an action_input key (tool input).

Valid "action" values: {tool_names}

Provide only ONE action per $JSON_BLOB, as shown:

```
{{
  "action": $TOOL_NAME,
  "action_input": $INPUT
}}
```
For each step, follow the format:
User query: <url>
Thought: what you should do next
Action: 
{{
  "action": "<tool>",
  "action_input": <tool_input>
}}
Observation: the result returned by the tool
... (repeat Thought/Action/Action Input/Observation as needed)
Thought: I now have the necessary information
Final Answer: the response to the user

Here are the tools you can use:
{tools}

Example 1:
User query: url
Thought: I need to get website data
Action: {{
 "action": the tool to use, one of [{tool_names}],
 "action_input": <tool_input>
 }}
Observation: I got the data.
Thought: I need to extract relevant informations
Observation: I got extracted data.
Thought: I need to verify it.
Action:
 {{
 "action": the verification tool to use, one of [{tool_names}],
 "action_input": <tool_input>
 }}
Observation: I got verified data.
Final Answer: extracted data
